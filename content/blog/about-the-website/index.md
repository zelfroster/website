## About this website
I had started making my [portfolio](https://portfolio.zelfroster.com) back in December 2022, I spent so much time on
it and It looked so good at that time, but as some time passed It started to 
look ugly to me (_don't ask reasons, ohh but you can't ask anything right now any
ways - Brook, One Piece_).

And, I had planned to write some blogs in the blog section of my portfolio but,
didn't write a single word there. To be Honest, I didn't felt like writing 
anything there.

So, I decided to make this website where I can do anything I want and show any
thing in way which I like and Not to impress people but just to be me. Also, I 
wanted to keep it minimal and remembered this Linux philosophy.

## Inspiration for this website

I took inspiration for this website from some cool folks. I will list their 
sites:
- [Manu Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/)
- [Suraj Kushwah](https://bugswriter.com/)
- [Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/)

## Tools used to make this website

> Well, Now I switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), I will write about it later.

I used only one tool to build this website.
Aaaaaaaaaaand, It's [11ty](https://11ty.dev). Yeah, I only used 11ty with some extra packages to make this website.

I used [eleventy-plugin-vite](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/server-vite/) to run [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as middleware and also to compile SCSS 
to CSS with the help of [sass](https://sass-lang.com). And, I also used [NunJucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as a templating 
language.

I found **11ty** much much better to build a personal website than any other 
JavaScript framework. I am not saying that they are bad or anything but 11ty is
just simpler and faster.
Using 11ty I was able to implement features in this website more easily than 
what I used earlier which was Next.js .

Specially, this feature, syntax-highlighting in code-blocks.~

```javascript
// JS code to print hello world
const hello = () => {
  console.log('Hello World');
}
hello()
  ```

This is still a work in progress as I have yet to put some content in here and
some more information about me.
I have a lot of features in my mind to implement here, but I am going to stop my
urge and keep this simple and clean.

So, This was it. I will see you soon and Have a Nice Day :)
